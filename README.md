# üñºÔ∏è Cover Change (Playnite Extension) 
Change game covers effortlessly.

‚ú® This Playnite extension lets you change game covers in a faster way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

- Just click `Cover Change` in the context menu
- Choose `Batch` to select multiple images at once (covers are applied automatically in alphabetical order).
- Select `Open metadata folder` to open game's images folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- The features of this extension are already included in the more advanced CoverStyleSwitcher. However, I created this extension to provide the fastest possible way to change a game's cover.
- If you just want a single item in the context menu (like *"Cover Change"*) apply a # at line 55 and remove the # from the line 56.

If you enjoy the extension, you can buy me a coffee. It will be greatly appreciated ;)
