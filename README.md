# üöÄ CoverChange-PlayniteExtension
*Change game covers effortlessly.*

‚ú® This Playnite extension lets you change game covers in a faster way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

- Just click `Cover Change` on the context menu
- Choose `Batch` to select multiple images at once.
- Covers are applied in alphabetical order.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- The features of this extension are already included in the more advanced CoverStyleSwitcher. However, I created this extension to provide the fastest possible way to change a game's cover.
- If you just want only a voice in the context menu (like *"Cover Change"*) apply a # at line 39 and remove the # from the line 40.

If you enjoy the extension, you can buy me a coffee. It will be very appreciated ;)
